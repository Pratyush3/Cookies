First, cream the sugars with butter using an electric mixer. Second, add eggs and vanilla
extract. Then, combine the flour, salt, and leavening agents into the same bowl. Mix in the
chocolate chips. Once the ingredients are combined, scoop the dough on to a cookie sheet
leaving space for the cookies to spread while baking. Bake in the oven. Finally, cool on a
wire rack.

Like any kind of baking, it's important to follow a chocolate chip cookie recipe. Imprecise
measurements will yield less-than-tasty cookies.
