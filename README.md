Introduction

Chocolate chip cookies are a drop-cookie many people like to eat. Some people like their
cookies crispy. Some people like chewy cookies. (I prefer chewy ones!) It doesn’t matter how
you like your cookies, what matters is that you find the right recipe so you can bake the ones you
like the best!
I’ve been baking chocolate chip cookies from scratch for years. I’ve tried many different
recipes – some of which I have liked and some I haven’t. I’ve made mistakes in the kitchen, but
I’ve learned from all of them. It has taken me a lot of trial and error, but I have learned how to
bake delicious chocolate chip cookies!


Chapter 1: Ingredients and General Directions
Chocolate chip cookies are made with flour, a leavening agent (like baking powder),
salt, sugars, eggs, vanilla extract, and chocolate chips. Some people choose to add nuts to their
chocolate chip cookies.
The type and ratio of ingredients, as well as the cooking time, affect the way the cookie
tastes. However, there are basic steps you need to follow when you’re making chocolate chip
cookies:
First, cream the sugars with butter using an electric mixer. Second, add eggs and vanilla
extract. Then, combine the flour, salt, and leavening agents into the same bowl. Mix in the
chocolate chips. Once the ingredients are combined, scoop the dough on to a cookie sheet
leaving space for the cookies to spread while baking. Bake in the oven. Finally, cool on a
wire rack.
Like any kind of baking, it's important to follow a chocolate chip cookie recipe. Imprecise
measurements will yield less-than-tasty cookies.


Chapter 2: Tips for Delicious Cookies
Butter is one of the most important parts of a chocolate chip cookie recipe. Most recipes
call for room temperature butter so it's easy to cream with sugar. If you use refrigerated butter,
it'll clump together with the sugar when you mix it. If you're short on time and melt the butter in
a microwave, then the butter and sugar mixture will be runny. Too-cold or melted butter will
affect the way your cookies taste when they're finished baking. To get the butter to room
temperature, remove it from the refrigerator and let it sit on the countertop for 30-45 minutes
before you start baking.
America’s Test Kitchen states “even a tablespoon too much or too little flour can have an
impact on cookies.” (http://bit.ly/1GxAlrf) Therefore, weigh flour on a kitchen sale to make sure
you use a precise amount. If you don’t have a kitchen scale, use something with a flat edge to
level-off the amount of flour you place in a measuring cup.
Speaking of dry ingredients, use a whisk to combine the flour, salt, and leavening
agents before you combine them with the wet ingredients. Whisking your dry ingredients
allows you to combine these ingredients without going through the trouble and mess of using a
sifter. Plus, this allows you to evenly distribute your ingredients (http://bit.ly/1PUWqln).
Even though it saves time to make two batches of cookies at the same time, you
shouldn’t! Place one cookie sheet in the oven at a time. This will keep your cookies from being
undercooked or becoming burnt (http://bit.ly/1GxAlrf)! 


Chapter 3: Predictable Problems
PROBLEM SOLUTION
Your cookies are burned on the bottom. Line your baking sheet with parchment
paper, then bake.
Your cookies aren’t round because they stick
together while baking.
Use an ice cream scooper to remove batter
from the bowl. Then, stagger your cookies in
different rows on your baking sheet. And
remember, don’t overcrowd your pan!
Your cookies don’t brown evenly in the oven. Rotate your baking sheet halfway through.
Your cookies are dry. Check your brown sugar. Is it moist? If not,
buy a new bag of brown sugar for the next
time.
Your cookies are flat. Did you cream your sugars and butter
together for 3 – 5 minutes using an electric
mixer? If not, be sure to beat your sugars and
butter longer next time so that you’ll have
fluffier cookies.
Chapter 4: Enjoy Your Cookies
Chef Ina Garten said:
“You can be miserable before you have a cookie and you can be miserable after you eat a
cookie but you can't be miserable while you are eating a cookie.”
Have you ever had a bad day? You can make it better by putting cookies on a plate, pouring
yourself a glass of milk, and enjoying the taste of a homemade chocolate chip cookie!
